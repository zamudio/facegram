Module Two Final Project
========================

### Goal

* The goal of this project was to attempt to build out the backend of a             social media app. I wanted to challenge myself to work with multiple          models, multiple functions such as likes, follows, comments, etc.

### Current Issues

* validations isn't finished
* restricting users to only editing their info/posts isn't finished
* frontend isn't close to finished

### Installation

* Fork the repository
* In your terminal:
    * type 'bundle install' and hit enter
    * type 'rake db:migrate' and hit enter
    * type 'rake db:seed' and hit enter
* After that, everything should be good to go

### Running the program

* Go to your browser and type 'http://localhost:3000'

### How to use the program

* The initial page will be the login page
* If you are not a current user, click signup and become one!
* As a user...
    * You can view all posts from all users
    * You can click on the image to go to see the post with comments
    * You can click on the username of a person who posted and see their            profile
    * You can edit posts you made
    * You can delete posts
    * You can like posts
    * You can follow others
    * You can leave comments on posts
* And more...
